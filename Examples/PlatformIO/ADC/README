ADC Example
===========

The example in this folder initialises the ADC with a prescaler of divide by 128, 
using ADC0 (Arduino A0, AVR PC0) as the input pin and AVCC as the reference voltage.
The ADC interrupt is used to copy the ADC reading into a variable each time a new
value is available.

Timer1 is initialised to use a divide by 64 clock source in 8 bit phase correct PWM
mode with OC1A (Arduino D9, AVR pin PB1) set to clear on TCNT1 matching OCR1A. this is
effectively the Arduino's analogWrite() function.

With a 10K potentiometer attached to 5V and GND and the wiper attached to pin ADC0/A0/PC0
and an LED's anode attached to pin D9/PB1 via a 560 Ohm resistor, and cathode to GND,
turning the pot causes the LED to brighten and dim accordingly.

Connections
-----------

5V -> Potentiometer pin 1.
GND -> Potentiometer pin 3.
Arduino A0, AVR PC0 -> Potentiometer pin 2 (wiper).
Arduino D9, AVR PB1 -> 560 Ohm resistor, pin 1.
560 Ohm resistor pin 2 -> LED Anode (longer lead).
LED cathode -> GND.
