Comparator Example
==================

The example in this folder initialises the Analogue Comparator with the reference
voltage on Arduino D6, AVR AIN0, and the sample voltage on Arduino D7, AVR AIN1. The
interrupt is enabled and set to fire when the ACO bit toggles from HIGH to LOW or 
LOW to HIGH.

The interrupt routine simple sets Arduino D13 (builtin LED), AVR pin PB5, to the 
state of the ACO bit.

A voltage divider is set up between VCC and GND. I used a pair of 560 Ohm resistors
joined in series with the mid-point connected to Arduino D6, AIN0, as the reference
voltage - roughly one half of VCC.

With a 10K potentiometer attached to 5V and GND and the wiper attached to pin AIN1, 
Arduino D7, and an LED's anode attached to pin D13/PB5 via a 560 Ohm resistor, and 
cathode to GND, turning the pot causes the LED to turn on and off depending on the
state of the ACO bit whihc itself is toggled by the voltage on D7/AIN1 as compared 
to D6/AIN0.
