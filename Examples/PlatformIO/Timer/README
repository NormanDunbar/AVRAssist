Timer Example
=============

The example in this folder initialises the 16 bit Timer/counter 1 running in 
CTC+OCR1A mode (Cleare Timer on Compare with OCR1A as TOP) with a divide by 256 
clock source and pin OCRA, Arduino pin D9, set to toggle on compare match.

OCR1A ia set to 31249 to get about 1 second flash rate.

Connections
-----------

Arduino D9, AVR PB1 -> 560 Ohm resistor pin 1.
560 Ohm resistor pin 2 -> LED Anode (longer lead).
LED cathode -> GND.

See Timer.* in the Fritzing folder.
