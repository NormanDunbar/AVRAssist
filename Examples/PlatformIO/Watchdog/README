Watchdog Example
================

The example in this folder initialises the Watchdog Timer to
fire an interrupt every 2 seconds. The interrupt will toggle 
the Arduino's built in LED on pin D13 which for an AVR is pin
PB5.

Connections
-----------

Arduino D13, AVR PB5 -> 560 Ohm resistor pin 1.
560 Ohm resistor pin 2 -> LED Anode (longer lead).
LED cathode -> GND.

See Watchdog.* in the Fritzing folder.
